# Portfolio

It is a dummy portfolio website containing 
lorem text and images. It can be used as a real 
portfolio website as all the data inserted is dynamic 
and the code written in easy and readable format using components 
or react. This website is Single page website (using router-dom) which will 
never load the page whle switching between pages.
On addition I have used styled-components 
for better and simple working with CSS.

In future I'll continue this website as my personal website and will update it time 
to time.
